## Issues
### Issue Title
The issue title represents the issue, so please choose one that fits. You cannot assign any tags 
by yourself, but adding a word like 'Add' or 'Fix' as the first word really helps to oversee the issues.
Also, it's important to keep the title short enough to be readable as a whole without breaking the line.
Not needed, but nice to have: Captitalize the first word. It looks better.
### Issue Body
Here you can be more specific as you were in the title, so please explain what has happened or what
you want to add. Please write whole, grammaticaly correct, sentences and if you can, format your texts with 
markdown. Also remember: One picture says more than a thousand words. In issues pics, gifs or videos can really help
and are better then 'this thing there is broken. go fix it'. It also helps if you have a bit knowledge about what you're talking when you specify the problem. For example the taskbar on you PC is not called "The thing down there where you can start your apps". 
### Comments
This is the place to disguss. Don't get angry if someone don't share your opinion, rather try to convince him while staying friendly. This is the most important thing: If your unfriendly no matter your skill level, no one will respect you. Always remember that you're the one who wants something.
### Reactions
Software projects are mostly driven by community feedpack and ideas, so if you read another issue that wants to add a feature, react to it by writing something like "I like / don't like it" or by using the emoticons to show the creators what you want. This is the most valuable feedpack a developer can have. 
## Pull Requests
In order to create a Pull Request, you have to create a fork first. If you still have problems getting your branch working, create an issue explaining what your problem is.  
When you're about creating a pull request, you have to name it after it contains, for example: You created feature X, then name it after this feature. You created a fix for a issue, name it 'Fix #tag-of-the-issue' so everyone knows what you were doing.  
**KEEP IN MIND THAT PULL REQUEST WITH A BASE BRANCH OF 'MASTER' OR 'DEV' WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED. CREATE ONE BRANCH FOR ONE FIX OR FEATURE. ALSO KEEP IN MIND THAT THE BRANCH NAME HAS TO REPRESENTATE THE CHANGES IT CONTAINS.**
